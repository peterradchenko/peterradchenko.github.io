I am a Professor of Professor of Statistics at the [University of Sydney Business School](https://www.sydney.edu.au/business/). Prior to joining the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/), I held academic positions at the University of Chicago and in the Marshall School of Business at the University of Southern California. He has a PhD in Statistics from Yale University, and an undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics, from the Lomonosov Moscow State University.



My research interests are in developing new methodology for dealing with massive and complex modern data, particularly in the area of high-dimensional regression, where the number of predictors is large relative to the number of observations. A more recent line of my research takes advantage of the impressive advances in mixed integer optimization and modern optimization techniques to solve and analyse critically important discrete problems arising in statistics.  I have also worked on the problems of large-scale cluster analysis, functional data analysis, large-scale estimation and inference, and correlation screening.
